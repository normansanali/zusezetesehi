Though rules and restrictions change from season to season, the objective has always remained the same: Make RuPaul laugh. It’s the mother of all comedy challenges on a reality show, and we’ve seen some, shall we say, varied results over the years. Ahead of season ten’s highly anticipated Game of Snatch, we look back on all the performances throughout Drag Race herstory with this comprehensive list of every Snatch Game impersonation (not counting the first season of All Stars, which had an alternative take on the game), ranked from least to most hilariously Snatched. Between the obvious duds and the wide swath of mediocre performances that take us through to the all-time greats, let’s see where we’ve got a match!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnk1kt001d3b60grxlpl9w@published>87.

After RuPaul asked whether she’s kissed a girl, Alyssa’s response — “Ru, never!” — suggested that she had no idea what “I Kissed a Girl” is about, and that she should have picked literally anyone else to impersonate. We already knew Alyssa existed in her own world, but this was next level. She had immunity that week and was spared from elimination, but Alyssa earns the bottom spot on this list for the hands-down worst Snatch Game performance ever. Without condition. Unconditionally, even.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnkfhj001k3b60ystk8aui@published>86.

The latter is the issue here, since Max did a decent job of looking like the spooky queen we all know and love, but had no jokes to supplement the visuals. You’d think that an incorrect answer would at least set her up for a “Welp, back to Party City where I belong,” but no such luck!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqnkq5a001r3b60ibd4ch0i@published>85.

Maybe we should give Sonique the benefit of the doubt — this was the very first Snatch Game, back in 2010 when Gaga was arguably more nondescript — but her performance was devoid of any quality whatsoever, and that’s reason enough to rank her so low.

It’s an example of how an impression doesn’t need to be actually good or right to be very good and dead on.

Sure, 90 percent of this was directly quoting lines from Mommie Dearest, and there was very little to no vocal affect at all, but Alyssa completely sold you on it because she was having the most fun. “Barbara please!” coming out of nowhere and “This ain’t my first time … at the Snatch Game” were both designed to slay in this format, and Alyssa finally understood the assignment three years after botching her first go at it. Forget Roxxxy Andrews; this is the real redemption arc of the whole series, or at least the moment that made Alyssa’s glow-up so undeniable. Expectations for Alyssa were almost insurmountably high going into All Stars 2, and she scaled the whole damn mountain with this pseudo-impression that only made us love her more.

Still, her performance as Monique — or rather, as Mary from Precious — felt fresh and topical back in 2011. At the time, this character was still front and center in the cultural consciousness, and was almost tailor-made to be sent up by drag queens nationwide. Stacy Layne was more than up to the challenge, cutting an imposing and comic figure at the same time. In what was collectively the weakest Snatch Game, it was more than enough to snag the win.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqoc52g00be3b60mhirokus@published>14.

It was an inspired choice that spoke to Adore’s self-awareness as she leaned into her strengths as a lovable slipshod, and flashed a spotlight on her as a magnetic performer next to the likes of Bianca del Rio and BenDeLaCreme. That we’ll never know how her Jan Crouch impression would have done on All Stars 2 is an unknowable disappointment.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqocj9l00bl3b60y5dg0i4w@published>13.

She knew exactly how to filter her intense verbosity through Suze Orman, and for her All Stars Snatch Game performance, she focused on showcasing her trademark eccentricity. Here we got a glimpse of just how bizarrely Katya’s mind works in a performance as one of the strangest, most visionary figures in today’s popular culture. This could have felt like a “been there, done that” situation, as we’ve all seen many, many impressions of Bjork over the years, but Katya’s version of the Icelandic diva was less a by-the-numbers “Watch me shout-sing about how I once was eaten by a mountain and survived” nonsense parade and more of a glimpse into Katya’s humor through the Björk lens. Bonus points for not coming out in a swan dress and for literally eating one of her answer cards.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqod25w00bs3b60ars2tdj9@published>12.

A quick look back at the tape confirms that Pandora’s Carol Channing made RuPaul laugh the hardest of any contestant that day, and therefore her loss is all the more confusing given that the challenge is simple: Make Ru laugh. Everything you would wish for in a drag queen’s take on Carol Channing was here: the voice, the irreverence, the manic look in her eye, the reference to a lovely bunch of coconuts. We aren’t necessarily in the “Pandora was done wrong!” crowd overall, but it’s very difficult to argue that this wasn’t the single best comedic performance on season two of Drag Race, maybe excluding Jujubee’s work in the soap-opera scene opposite RuPaul, but we digress. Pandora set the standard for future Snatch Game performances in the very first iteration of it, and her legacy remains strong.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqodjbw00bz3b608l0vw4tw@published>11.

With Lady Bunny being one of RuPaul’s longtime peers in the drag community, you can tell Ru had the time of his life simply listening to whatever it is Alaska’s Bunny had to say. Come to think of it, the real Alaska does recall a young Lady Bunny in a way, and she’s well on her way to becoming just as prolific of a drag legend.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqodzp800c63b60t65akfs2@published>10.

Every detail was so astoundingly specific as Sharon regaled everyone with anecdotes about working Susanne Bartsch’s parties for a buffalo nickel and doing hard drugs at the Limelight. While everyone else on season four’s Snatch Game got steamrolled into one fiasco or another, Sharon stuck to her specifics and delivered Drag Race’s first truly great self-referential Snatch Game impression.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqoedd100cd3b606vblqmne@published>9.

Professional that she is, Bianca came confident and prepared, even having a puppet of Officer Bert on hand to weigh in. The way she read other contestants as they struggled with their characters was simultaneously classic Bianca and classic Judge Judy, and as the game progressed, it became clear that this was the character Del Rio was destined to play, or at least the gavel she was destined to bang.

Some would argue that Liza imitations are well-trod in the drag community, but the fact that Alexis was the first Drag Race queen to play her should silence any detractors. At the end of the day, it was a funny, faithful tribute. The kicks and the giggles and the “Mamas” all congealed into a loving send-up of the iconic film star, and best of all, it wasn’t mean-spirited or lowbrow in the least.

To our shock and delight, Kennedy embellished her raunchy take on the glam rocker with howls and falsetto riffs that made this one of the all-time greats. The small compact mirror she peered into was the perfect touch, and her answer about Batman and Robin converting the Batcave into a bathhouse decimated the competition right then and there. The risk in portraying the first non-female celebrity on Snatch Game could have backfired spectacularly, but Kennedy stuck the landing and then took off with the win.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqofkex00cy3b60o4jomuyo@published>6.

It was the single most genius answer in any Snatch Game, and it succeeded as a buttress to Ben’s overall performance as Maggie Smith à la the Dowager Countess of Grantham. Referring to Chelsea Handler as Lady Handler? Genius. Clapping back at Nicki Minaj about originating the English language? Amazing. That patrician-as-hell hat? Gag. Every moment was brilliant, and it’s even more impressive that Ben would go on to outdo herself on All Stars 2.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqofy2p00d53b60xrbfgdnr@published>5.

After leaving everyone in the dust with a batty Crazy Eyes bit, she quick-changed into an even battier Carol Channing, who hijacked Robbie Turner’s bland answer and rambled about being on Lipitor for years. The best moment was when Bob extolled the virtues of Fleet-brand enemas, saying, “If you stay ready, you ain’t got to get ready.” Classic Carol! By flipping the table and bending race in her brilliant way, Bob cemented her standing as a frontrunner and immortalized herself as a superior Snatch Game player in the show’s herstory.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjgqogcuq00dc3b604kqvxxe7@published>4.

With the challenge’s gender restrictions tossed out the window long ago by Kennedy Davenport, this is far and away the best male drag on the show so far. Outside of completely resembling and embodying the iconic Hollywood Squares regular, DeLa pulled out jokes on jokes on jokes without ever letting up on specifics. When you consider the untouchable precedent she set for herself with Maggie Smith, this performance — which couldn’t have been more different in both rhythm and specificity — solidified BenDeLaCreme’s status as one of the best comedians in Drag Race canon. The interactions with Kristin Chenoweth were delicious, as were the back-and-forths with RuPaul. For Ben to use Snatch Game as a space to flourish and dominate the competition was remarkable, and we’re mostly just sad we can’t see more!

This performance was a bit meta in that Chad’s Cher became absolutely fed up with the foolish antics on season four’s infamous Snatch Game and declared herself to be better than the whole operation. “I don’t know why they book me on these chicken shit gigs. I’m an Oscar winner!” We were convinced that not only was this true for Cher, but also for Chad Michaels herself, who is simply in a different league than almost every other queen when it comes to celebrity impersonations. After all, this is someone who has made her life’s work being the best goddamn Cher impersonator there is. The reinventions via wig reveals, the casual profanity, and yes, the voice were all here, cultivated to Goddess of Pop perfection.

Those familiar with Little Edie have to be blown away by the attention to detail Jinkx provided here, not only nailing the costuming (the revolutionary costume for today!) and accessories (the magnifying glass, even!), but also that bougie yet still Long Island accent.

There was not a moment wasted, not a joke missed, not a dip in the commitment to the character, nothing. “Why don’t you come up and fuck me in the ass sometime?” You’ve got to be kidding. No other platform in today’s fragmented media landscape could facilitate a gem of a one-liner like that, and Alaska claimed that platform as her own to give us as tight of a comedic performance as we’ll see on television. Ru himself couldn’t get enough of Alaska’s Mae West, and he may have even been caught a little off guard at how ready she was to absolutely smash every assist he threw her way. “You don’t beat around the bush, do you?” Ru asked, but before he even finished the question, Alaska swooped in with a “Whaddaya mean? I beat around the bush all the time!” The tiny moans, the snatched vintage look, the drooping tongue, it was all perfect. Comedically, it’s Old Hollywood meets raw Alaska humor, and so it bears repeating: It was all perfect.
